$ Baramura GT Ext. UnitV (21MW) commissioned on 3.8.201
Note:,(1) Barge mounted 220 MW CCPP (Tanir Bavi) of GMR Energy Ltd.under the category of liquid fuel based power stations has since been shifted to Kakinada,East Godavari Distt,Andhra Pradesh form Mangalore 
,Karnataka and recommissioned on Natural Gas as primary fuel in the month of Aug 2010. (2) Gas from RIL (KG D-6) has been allocated to this plant. (3) The plant has thus
,become gas based CCPP. This station shall be included in the list of gas based GT station once the changes are made in CEA records by DMLF Div.
