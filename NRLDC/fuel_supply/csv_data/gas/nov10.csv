Note: (1) Barge mounted 220 MW CCPP (Tanir Bavi) of GMR Energy Ltd.under the category of liquid fuel based power stations has since been shifted to Kakinada,East Godavari Distt,Andhra Pradesh
form Mangalore 
,Karnataka and recommissioned on Natural Gas as primary fuel in the month of Aug 2010. (2) Gas from RIL (KG D-6) has been allocated to this plant. (3) The plant has thus
 become gas based CCPP. This station shall be included in the list of gas based GT station once the changes are made in CEA records by DMLF Div.
* Normative gas requirement at 90% PLF taking GCV of gas =9000 k.Cal/SCM (except for Ramgarh CCGT for which GCV is 4150 k. Cal/SCM) and
 Station Heat Rate- 2900 k. Cal/kWh for open cycle & 2000 k.Cal/kWh for combined cycle.
.+ Including R-LNG
